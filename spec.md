# macOS Accessibility MCP Server Specification

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes macOS accessibility APIs to Large Language Models (LLMs) over the stdio protocol. The server will allow LLMs like Claude to interact with macOS applications using the same accessibility APIs available to users, enabling them to perform user-level tasks such as browsing the web, creating presentations, working with spreadsheets, or using messaging applications.

## Core Requirements

### General Design

- **Implementation Type**: Standalone Swift application
- **Protocol**: Use the existing Swift MCP SDK for protocol implementation
- **Operation Mode**: Command-line tool
- **Request Handling**: Process requests synchronously (one at a time)
- **macOS Support**: Focus on the latest version of macOS
- **Licensing**: MIT License

### Authentication & Permissions

- Run with the user's full permissions once launched
- No additional permission model or security limitations beyond macOS's built-in controls

### Accessibility API Integration

- Expose all accessibility properties available through the macOS Accessibility API
- Provide a hierarchical representation of UI elements (somewhere between a pure tree and a flattened list)
- Require explicit requests from the LLM for UI state updates (no automatic notifications)

### UI Interaction Capabilities

Focus on the following user-level interactions:
- Navigate UI elements
- Read screen content
- Click buttons
- Type text
- Drag and drop
- Access menus

### Visual Information

- Include the ability to capture and transmit screenshots to the LLM

### Error Handling

- Provide detailed error descriptions when actions fail
- Report errors to the LLM and let it decide how to handle recovery

### Logging & Debugging

- Include detailed logs of all actions taken for debugging purposes

## Development Approach

- Focus on correctness first, then optimize for performance later
- Implement incremental releases with specific feature sets
- Include testing tools to validate the implementation

## First Release (MVP) Capabilities

The first minimal viable product should support:
1. Opening an application (e.g., a web browser)
2. Navigating the application's interface
3. Performing basic operations (e.g., navigating to a webpage)
4. Reading content from the application
5. Returning structured information back to the LLM

## API Design Considerations

### Server Initialization

- Initialize using the MCP Swift SDK's Server class
- Configure appropriate capabilities (tools, resources)
- Set up stdio transport for communication

### Element Representation

- Expose the full hierarchical structure of UI elements
- Include all available properties for each element
- Provide mechanisms to query and filter elements

### Core Actions

Implement tools for the following key actions:
- Get current UI state (with filtering options)
- Capture screenshot
- Click/tap on element
- Type text into element
- Navigate to element
- Scroll content
- Access menus and select menu items

### Documentation

- Provide basic usage instructions
- Include API documentation for all available actions
- Document error codes and their meanings

## Testing and Validation

- Include tools to validate the implementation against actual macOS applications
- Provide examples of common interaction patterns
- Include automated tests where appropriate

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- Performance optimizations
- More complex interactions (copy/paste, drag and drop)
- System-level operations
- Additional notification types
- Potential integration with other applications

This specification outlines the initial design for the macOS Accessibility MCP Server. The implementation will focus on creating a functional command-line tool that allows LLMs to interact with macOS applications through a structured API based on the MCP protocol and built with the Swift MCP SDK.
