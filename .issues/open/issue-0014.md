# Issue 0002: Improve Uniqueness of Non-Menu UI Element Identifiers

## Problem to be solved
The current identifier generation for non-menu UI elements relies on a fingerprinting and hashing system that combines element properties. While generally effective, there are improvements that could be made to ensure greater uniqueness and stability:

1. The current system relies heavily on position and size, which can lead to duplicate IDs for similar elements with the same dimensions
2. Hashing doesn&#x27;t always produce unique results when elements have very similar properties
3. The system doesn&#x27;t take into account structural information like the element&#x27;s path or index in its parent
4. Few guarantees exist for elements with unstable positions (e.g., in scrollable lists)

We should enhance the identifier generation for non-menu elements to increase uniqueness and reliability across different applications.

## Planned approach
1. Analyze the current identifier generation in AccessibilityElement.swift to understand its strengths and weaknesses
2. Examine cases where duplicate IDs are being generated and identify patterns
3. Enhance the fingerprinting system to include more uniqueness factors:
   - Add hierarchy information (index in parent, siblings count)
   - Include more attributes that might differentiate similar elements
   - Consider parent information where appropriate
   - Add structural context (depth in tree, relative path)
4. Implement a hybrid approach that combines:
   - Native ID when available and reliable
   - Hierarchical information (similar to menu paths but less aggressive)
   - Traditional property-based hashing as a fallback
5. Improve the fallback mechanisms when native IDs are missing or non-unique
6. Create diagnostic tools to detect and report duplicate IDs in the accessibility hierarchy
7. Implement improved ID generation that maintains stability across app restarts
8. Create tests to verify uniqueness of generated identifiers
