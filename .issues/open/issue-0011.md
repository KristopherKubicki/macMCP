# Issue 0011: Add Cross-Application Clipboard Tests

## Problem to be solved
Currently, there are no end-to-end tests for clipboard operations between different applications, which is a key functionality that LLMs will need to use.

## Planned approach
Create a new test suite for cross-application clipboard operations using the ClipboardManagementTool, testing copy/paste operations between TextEdit and other applications.
