# UI Element Path-based Identifier Implementation Plan

This document presents an ordered series of prompts for implementing a path-based UI element identification system in MacMCP. Each step follows test-driven development (TDD) practices and includes clear commit instructions.

## Current Status

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Create ElementPath Model and Parser 

The core ElementPath model and parser must besuccessfully implemented with the following features:

- **Path Syntax**: Supports paths like `ui://AXWindow/AXScrollArea/AXTextArea[@name="Content"]`
- **Path Components**:
  - Path ID prefix: `ui://`
  - Path segments with roles: `AXWindow/AXGroup/AXButton`
  - Attribute selectors: `[@title="Save"][@description="Save button"]` 
  - Index selectors: `[2]` (for selecting nth matching element)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for validation failures
- **Parsing & Generation**: Full support for both parsing paths from strings and generating path strings

**Design Notes**:
- When generating paths, we should always try to have a unique attribute at each level. it might be the identifier or description or name or value
- The `ElementPath` struct contains:
  - `segments`: Array of `PathSegment` objects representing the path hierarchy
- The nested `PathSegment` struct contains:
  - `role`: Accessibility role (e.g., "AXButton")
  - `attributes`: Dictionary of attribute name/value pairs
  - `index`: Optional index for selecting among multiple matches

## Phase 1: Core Element Path Infrastructure

### ðŸ”² Step 2: Element Path Resolution Logic

**Prompt for LLM agent:**
```
Implement the resolution logic for ElementPath that converts a path string into an actual AXUIElement. Follow TDD principles:

1. Extend ElementPathTests.swift with tests for path resolution
2. Create test fixtures or mocks to validate resolution logic
3. Implement these methods in ElementPath:
   - `resolve(using: AccessibilityService) async throws -> AXUIElement?`
   - `resolveSegment(element: AXUIElement, segment: PathSegment) async throws -> AXUIElement?`
4. Add integration tests with real applications if possible

The path resolution should:
- Start with the application element
- Traverse through each path segment
- Match elements based on role, attributes, and index
- Handle error cases when elements can't be found

Commit the changes with message: "Add ElementPath resolution logic with tests"
```

### ðŸ”² Step 3: UIElement Path Extension

**Prompt for LLM agent:**
```
Extend UIElement with methods to generate and parse paths. Follow TDD approach:

1. Write tests in UIElementTests.swift for path generation from existing UIElements
2. Add tests for comparing UIElements via their paths
3. Implement these extensions:
   - `UIElement.generatePath() -> String?`
   - `UIElement.init(fromPath: String, accessibilityService: AccessibilityService) async throws`
4. Ensure path generation captures the element's hierarchy accurately
5. Add static comparison methods to determine if two paths reference the same element

Paths should include relevant attributes (title, description, identifier) that would help uniquely identify an element.

```

## Phase 2: Service Layer Integration

### ðŸ”² Step 4: Update AccessibilityService for Path Support

**Prompt for LLM agent:**
```
Update AccessibilityService to support finding elements by path. Follow TDD:

2. Create tests that verify path-based element lookup
3. Add these methods to AccessibilityService:
   - `findElementByPath(_ path: String) async throws -> UIElement?`
   - `findApplicationElementByBundleId(_ bundleId: String) async throws -> AXUIElement?`
4. Update existing find methods to optionally accept paths
5. Add performance optimizations like caching for repeated path lookups

Make sure the implementation handles error cases gracefully and provides useful diagnostic information when paths can't be resolved.

```

### ðŸ”² Step 5: Enhance UIInteractionService with Path Support

**Prompt for LLM agent:**
```
Update UIInteractionService to prioritize path-based element lookups. Follow TDD:

1. Write tests in UIInteractionServiceTests.swift for path-based interactions
2. Update these methods to handle paths:
   - `getAXUIElement(for identifier: String) async throws -> AXUIElement`
   - `clickElement(identifier: String) async throws`
   - Other interaction methods
3. Add a mechanism to detect if an identifier is a path
4. Implement optimized caching for path resolution
5. Add detailed error reporting for path resolution failures

The implementation should:
- Check if an identifier is a path (starts with 'ui:')
- Use path-based resolution for paths
- Fall back to existing methods for legacy identifiers
- Prioritize paths for reliability

2. Implement utilities for common path-based operations:
   - `findElementByPath(_ path: String) async throws -> UIElement?`
   - `clickElementByPath(_ path: String) async throws`
   - `typeTextInElementByPath(_ path: String, text: String) async throws`
   - `verifyElementExistsByPath(_ path: String) async throws -> Bool`
3. Add methods to generate paths for common UI elements
4. Create methods to find common elements with partial paths

The test helpers should make it easy to:
- Find elements using paths in tests
- Generate paths for discovered elements
- Interact with elements using paths
- Validate element properties using paths

5. Add helper methods to generate common paths

For example, change:
```swift
static let button1ID = "ui:AXButton:123456"
```

To:
```swift
static let button1Path = "ui://AXWindow/AXGroup/AXButton[@description=\"1\"]"
```

Commit the changes with message: "Update application models to use path-based identifiers"

- Documenting the path strategy

Commit the changes in logical groups with messages like:
"Update Calculator tests to use path-based identifiers"
"Update TextEdit tests to use path-based identifiers"
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test-First Development**: Always write tests before implementing functionality. Ensure tests fail before implementation and pass after.

2. **Commit Frequently**: Each logical chunk of work should be committed separately with clear messages.

3. **Error Handling**: Provide detailed error messages that help diagnose path resolution failures.

4. **Documentation**: Document the code thoroughly as you go, not just at the end.

5. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance, especially for deep path traversal.

6. **Compatibility**: While we're going all-in on paths, make sure error messages are helpful for users transitioning from the old system.

7. **Realistic Testing**: Test with real applications to ensure the solution works in practice, not just in theory.

## Design Decisions and Implementation Details

### Path Syntax

The path syntax follows a hierarchical approach similar to XPath or CSS selectors but specialized for accessibility elements:

- **Prefix**: `ui://` - Identifies that this is a path to an element
- **Segments**: `/AXRole` - Defines the accessibility role of the element
- **Attributes**: `[@attribute="value"]` - Optional attribute constraints to filter elements
- **Index**: `[n]` - Optional index to select a specific element when multiple match

### Path Resolution Strategy

The planned resolution strategy (to be implemented in Step 2):
1. Get the application element using the bundleID
2. For each path segment, resolve by:
   - Finding all children with the matching role
   - Filtering by attribute constraints
   - Selecting by index if needed

### Error Handling

A robust error handling system that provides clear diagnostic information:
- Path syntax validation errors
- Application not found errors
- Element resolution failures with context about where in the path the failure occurred

### Future Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement caching at various levels to improve performance for repeated path resolutions
- **Partial Path Resolution**: Allow resolving partial paths from a starting element, not just full paths
- **Relative Paths**: Consider supporting relative paths that don't start from the application root
