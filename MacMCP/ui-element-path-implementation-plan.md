# UI Element Path-based Identifier Implementation Plan (Updated)

This document presents a revised implementation plan for the path-based UI element identification system in MacMCP, prioritizing element path generation before element lookup functionality.

## Current Status

MacMCP currently identifies elements using a combination of approaches:
- Hash-based identifiers: `ui:<role>:<hash>` 
- Menu-specific path-like identifiers: `ui:menu:<menu path>`

The work on `f/ui-paths-take-2` branch has begun implementing a new path-based approach using syntax like `ui://AXWindow/AXScrollArea/AXTextArea[@name="Content"]` for non-menu elements.

## Implementation Strategy

The revised implementation prioritizes path generation tools before path resolution tools:

1. First, implement the tools that generate stable path-based identifiers for UI elements
2. Then, use the mcp-ax-inspector utility to examine real paths and verify their correctness
3. Finally, implement the tools that resolve paths into elements

This approach allows us to:
- Use the inspector tool to see real paths to elements
- Test path generation with real-world applications
- Fine-tune path syntax before implementing resolution

## Phase 1: Element Path Model & Generation

### ✅ Step 1: Create ElementPath Model and Parser (Completed)

The core ElementPath model and parser has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- **Path Syntax**: Supports paths like `ui://AXWindow/AXScrollArea/AXTextArea[@name="Content"]`
- **Path Components**:
  - Path ID prefix: `ui://`
  - Path segments with roles: `AXWindow/AXGroup/AXButton`
  - Attribute selectors: `[@title="Save"][@description="Save button"]` 
  - Index selectors: `[2]` (for selecting nth matching element)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for validation failures with detailed messages
- **Parsing & Generation**: Full support for both parsing paths from strings and generating path strings

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `ElementPath` struct with:
  - `segments`: Array of `PathSegment` objects representing the path hierarchy
  - Static parsing method that handles all syntax variations
  - Path generation and validation methods
- Implemented `PathSegment` struct with:
  - `role`: Accessibility role (e.g., "AXButton")
  - `attributes`: Dictionary of attribute name/value pairs
  - `index`: Optional index for selecting among multiple matches
- Added comprehensive test suite for path parsing and generation

### ✅ Step 2: Extend UIElement with Path Generation (Completed)

The UIElement path generation functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- **Implementation**: Added `UIElement.generatePath(includeValue: Bool, includeFrame: Bool) throws -> String` method
- **Path Construction**: Builds paths by traversing from the element up through its parent hierarchy
- **Attribute Selection**: Includes key identifying attributes like title, description, and custom identifiers
- **State Information**: Optionally includes element state (enabled, focused, selected) when relevant
- **Menu Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing menu path identifiers
- **Flexible Options**: Provides parameters to customize path content (values, frame info)

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering simple elements, parent hierarchies, and various attribute types
- Path segments include only meaningful attributes, avoiding empty or default values
- Hierarchical paths provide full context for reliable element identification
- Special handling for menu elements to ensure backward compatibility
- Support for boolean state attributes and custom identifiers

### ✅ Step 3: Update mcp-ax-inspector to Show Element Paths (Completed)

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Update the MCP accessibility inspector tool to display UI element paths
2. Add a flag to display full paths for all elements
3. Add a command-line option to filter elements by path patterns
4. Add a flag to highlight common interactive elements with their paths
5. Add documentation for using the inspector with paths

**Key Requirements:**
- The inspector should show the actual path that would be used to access each element
- Allow filtering elements by path segments or attributes
- Provide clear examples of how to use paths in UI interaction tools

### ✅ Step 4: Update InterfaceExplorerTool to Include Paths (Completed)

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. ✅ Write tests in InterfaceExplorerToolTests.swift
2. ✅ Update ElementDescriptor to include a path field

## Phase 2: Element Path Resolution

### ✅ Step 5: Implement ElementPath Resolution Logic (Completed)

The ElementPath resolution functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- **Core Implementation**:
  - Added `resolve(using: AccessibilityServiceProtocol) async throws -> AXUIElement` method
  - Added `resolveSegment(element: AXUIElement, segment: PathSegment, segmentIndex: Int) async throws -> AXUIElement?` method
  - Added `elementMatchesSegment(_ element: AXUIElement, segment: PathSegment) async throws -> Bool` helper method

- **Application Resolution Strategies**:
  - Bundle identifier-based application matching: `[@bundleIdentifier="com.apple.calculator"]`
  - Title-based application matching: `[@title="Calculator"]`
  - Fallback to focused/frontmost application when no specific attributes provided

- **Robust Resolution Logic**:
  - Traverses element hierarchy following the path segments
  - Matches elements based on role, attributes, and optional index
  - Handles edge cases like missing children or no matching elements
  - Provides detailed error messages indicating which segment failed and why

- **Comprehensive Testing**:
  - Mock-based tests for core resolution logic
  - Integration tests with Calculator app to verify real-world usage
  - Tests for all three application resolution strategies (bundleId, title, focused app)
  - Multiple path resolution scenarios including ambiguous matches and indexed resolution

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Error handling provides precise information about which segment failed and why
- Supports both exact attribute matches and partial text matches
- Fallback strategies ensure robust application element resolution
- Real-world integration tests verify the solution works with actual macOS applications

### Step 6: Extend UIElement with Path-based Initialization

**Implementation Tasks:**

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test-First Development**: Always write tests before implementing functionality. Ensure tests fail before implementation and pass after.

2. **Commit Frequently**: Each logical chunk of work should be committed separately with clear messages.

3. **Error Handling**: Provide detailed error messages that help diagnose path resolution failures.

4. **Documentation**: Document the code thoroughly as you go, not just at the end.

5. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance, especially for deep path traversal.

6. **Compatibility**: While we're going all-in on paths, make sure error messages are helpful for users transitioning from the old system.

7. **Realistic Testing**: Test with real applications to ensure the solution works in practice, not just in theory.

## Design Decisions and Implementation Details

### Path Syntax

The path syntax follows a hierarchical approach similar to XPath or CSS selectors but specialized for accessibility elements:

- **Prefix**: `ui://` - Identifies that this is a path to an element
- **Segments**: `/AXRole` - Defines the accessibility role of the element
- **Attributes**: `[@attribute="value"]` - Optional attribute constraints to filter elements
- **Index**: `[n]` - Optional index to select a specific element when multiple match

### Path Resolution Strategy

The resolution strategy:
1. Get the application element using the bundleID or frontmost app if not specified
2. For each path segment, resolve by:
   - Finding all children with the matching role
   - Filtering by attribute constraints
   - Selecting by index if needed

### Error Handling

A robust error handling system that provides clear diagnostic information:
- Path syntax validation errors
- Application not found errors
- Element resolution failures with context about where in the path the failure occurred

### Future Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement caching at various levels to improve performance for repeated path resolutions
- **Partial Path Resolution**: Allow resolving partial paths from a starting element, not just full paths
- **Relative Paths**: Consider supporting relative paths that don't start from the application root
- **Path Aliases**: Consider adding support for named path aliases for commonly used elements
