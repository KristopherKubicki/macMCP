# MacMCP Project Todo List

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Extend frame detection to handle all frame information types
- ✅ Add fallback mechanisms for zero-size frames

## High Priority Tasks
- ⬜ Implement multiple app detection strategies (bundle ID, name, partial matching)
- ⬜ Improve focus tracking with multiple detection methods
- ⬜ Implement multiple interaction methods (AX actions, mouse, keyboard)
- ⬜ Add pre-launch validation (verify app exists, check if running)
- ⬜ Implement post-launch verification (wait for initialization, verify window creation)
- ⬜ Develop application state observer to track running applications
- ⬜ Implement hierarchical frame inference (derive child positions from parents)
- ⬜ Support identifying elements by visible text
- ⬜ Enhance menu navigation with retry logic and robust discovery
- ⬜ Improve window management with caching and multiple lookup methods

## Medium Priority Tasks
- ⬜ Implement an intelligent element cache with fingerprinting
- ⬜ Create tool metadata system for validation and documentation
- ⬜ Implement comprehensive schema-based parameter validation
- ⬜ Develop error classification system with consistent codes
- ⬜ Enhance error logging with detailed context
- ⬜ Develop interaction verification to validate results
- ⬜ Add automatic retries with exponential backoff for failed interactions
- ⬜ Enhance timing management with UI stabilization waits
- ⬜ Expand unit test coverage for all tools
- ⬜ Implement integration tests with real applications
- ⬜ Test with diverse applications (system apps, third-party apps)
- ⬜ Create comprehensive API documentation
- ⬜ Enhance logging with structured logs and context
- ⬜ Add support for xpath-like element paths
- ⬜ Enhance UI tree traversal with fuzzy matching
- ⬜ Add element relationship tracking (parent-child, siblings, spatial)
- ⬜ Develop parameter preprocessor to normalize inputs
- ⬜ Add context-aware recovery suggestions for common errors
- ⬜ Implement self-healing mechanisms (auto-retry, fallbacks)
- ⬜ Implement a focus manager with history and restoration
- ⬜ Develop context-aware operations that work without focus
- ⬜ Enhance window identification with fuzzy matching
- ⬜ Implement adaptive timing based on application responsiveness
- ⬜ Develop element state prediction for validation
- ⬜ Create regression test suite for previously fixed issues
- ⬜ Implement continuous integration with test coverage tracking
- ⬜ Create application-specific test suites (Calculator, text editing)
- ⬜ Implement self-documenting tools with discovery
- ⬜ Develop debugging utilities (UI hierarchy explorer, element inspector)
