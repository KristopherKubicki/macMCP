# Path Resolution Debugging Plan

This document outlines a structured debugging plan for resolving issues with the ElementPath resolution system and the `--inspect-path` feature in mcp-ax-inspector. Each section contains a specific debugging prompt that can be executed by an LLM to help diagnose and fix the issues.

## 1. Diagnosing Path Resolution Failures

```
Analyze the ElementPath resolution system in the MacMCP project to diagnose why paths like "ui://AXApplication[@title=\"Calculator\"]/AXWindow[@title=\"Calculator\"]/AXGroup/AXSplitGroup/AXGroup/AXGroup" aren't resolving correctly.

Specifically:
1. Examine the path resolution code in ElementPath.swift
2. Identify how paths are parsed and matched against the UI hierarchy
3. Look for any discrepancies between how paths are generated (in MCPUIElementNode.swift) vs. how they're resolved
4. Check if there are any escaping issues with special characters in attribute values (like quotes)
5. Determine if there are any scope or context differences between path generation and resolution

Show the relevant code sections and explain the potential failure points.
```

## 2. Verifying Path Generation vs. Resolution

```
Compare how element paths are generated versus how they are resolved in the MacMCP codebase.

1. First, analyze the code in MCPUIElementNode.swift that generates paths (methods like generateSyntheticPath, calculateFullPath)
2. Then, examine how paths are resolved in ElementPath.swift (focus on the resolveElement or similar methods)
3. Create a side-by-side comparison showing:
   - How path segments are formatted during generation
   - How attribute selectors are constructed ([@attr="value"])
   - How these paths are parsed during resolution
   - Any transformation or normalization that happens to paths during either process

Highlight any inconsistencies in formatting, escaping, or structure that could cause resolution failures.
```

## 3. Testing the Path Parser Independently

```
Create a standalone test for the ElementPath parser to verify it works correctly in isolation:

1. Extract the core path parsing logic from ElementPath.swift
2. Design a test case that takes a sample path like "ui://AXApplication[@title=\"Calculator\"]/AXWindow[@title=\"Calculator\"]/AXGroup/AXSplitGroup" and parses it into components
3. Show the expected output for each stage of parsing
4. Identify if the parser correctly handles:
   - The "ui://" prefix
   - Element types (AXApplication, AXWindow, etc.)
   - Attribute selectors with various types of values
   - Escaping of special characters in attribute values
   - Multiple attribute selectors on a single element

If you find any issues, suggest specific fixes to the parser.
```

## 4. Analyzing InterfaceExplorerTool Path Handling

```
Analyze how the InterfaceExplorerTool handles element paths when used with the "element" scope:

1. Examine the code in InterfaceExplorerTool.swift, focusing on functions that process the "element" scope
2. Identify how it translates a path string into an actual AXUIElement reference
3. Determine if there are any limitations or requirements for path formats that might not be documented
4. Check if there are any error handling or logging mechanisms that could provide more insight into path resolution failures
5. Investigate if the tool properly handles different path formats (full paths vs. path segments)

Provide recommendations for improving the error reporting and diagnostics in the tool to make path resolution issues more transparent.
```

## 5. Debugging the --inspect-path Implementation

```
Debug the implementation of the --inspect-path feature in MCPInspector.swift to identify why paths like "ui://AXApplication[@title=\"Calculator\"]" aren't being resolved:

1. Examine the `inspectElementByPath` method in MCPInspector.swift
2. Trace the flow of how the path is processed and sent to the MCP server
3. Identify how the MCP server's response is handled
4. Check for any mismatches in path formatting between what's provided to the function and what's expected by the InterfaceExplorerTool
5. Look for any data transformations that might affect the path format

Also, examine the error response to understand exactly why the path resolution is failing at the MCP server level.
```

## 6. Escaping and Character Handling

```
Analyze how special characters and escaping are handled throughout the path resolution pipeline:

1. Examine how quotes, backslashes, and other special characters are escaped in:
   - Path generation (in MCPUIElementNode.swift)
   - Command line argument parsing (in main.swift)
   - Path resolution (in ElementPath.swift)
   - MCP request serialization (in MCPInspector.swift)

2. Identify any points where escaping might be incorrectly applied or removed
3. Check if there are inconsistencies in how characters are escaped across different components
4. Verify if any normalization is applied to paths at any stage

Suggest a consistent approach to handling special characters throughout the codebase.
```

## 7. Testing Direct Path Resolution

```
Design a focused test to directly examine path resolution:

1. Create a test that:
   - Gets the full accessibility tree from Calculator app
   - Extracts a known good path from one of the elements
   - Attempts to resolve that exact path back to the same element
   - Compares the resolved element with the original to verify correct resolution

2. If the resolution fails, modify the test to:
   - Try resolving paths with various modifications (different formats, escaping, etc.)
   - Log detailed information about why each attempt fails
   - Identify which path format successfully resolves

This test will help determine exactly what format of path works with the resolver.
```

## 8. Path Normalization Strategy

```
Design a path normalization strategy to ensure consistent handling across generation and resolution:

1. Define a standard format for element paths, including:
   - How element types are represented
   - How attributes are formatted
   - How special characters are escaped
   - How hierarchy is represented

2. Create utility functions for:
   - Normalizing paths before resolution
   - Normalizing paths after generation
   - Converting between different path formats if needed

3. Identify all places in the codebase where paths are generated or consumed
4. Recommend changes to ensure consistent path handling throughout

The goal is to ensure that any path generated by the system can be reliably resolved later.
```

## 9. Comparing Element Identifiers vs Paths

```
Analyze the relationship between element identifiers and element paths in MacMCP:

1. Compare the formats and uses of:
   - Hard element identifiers (e.g., ui:AXButton:b6e1b3b49306207a)
   - Path-based identifiers (e.g., ui://AXApplication[@title="Calculator"]/AXWindow)

2. Determine if both mechanisms use the same underlying resolution code
3. Check if the current implementation properly handles both types
4. Identify scenarios where one approach works but the other fails

Recommend a consistent strategy for element identification that works reliably for all use cases.
```

## 10. Implementing Progressive Path Resolution

```
Design an enhanced path resolution strategy using progressive resolution:

1. Create a function that resolves paths incrementally:
   - Start with the root element (ui://AXApplication)
   - Add one path segment at a time (ui://AXApplication/AXWindow)
   - Check resolution at each step
   - Continue until reaching the full path or finding a failure point

2. Enhance the error reporting to show:
   - The last successfully resolved path segment
   - The specific segment that failed to resolve
   - Possible reasons for the resolution failure (missing element, attribute mismatch, etc.)

3. Implement this in the `--inspect-path` feature to provide better diagnostics

This approach will help pinpoint exactly where in a path the resolution is failing.
```

## 11. Path Resolution Performance Analysis

```
Analyze the performance characteristics of path resolution in MacMCP:

1. Identify potential performance bottlenecks in the path resolution process
2. Measure the relative cost of:
   - Parsing path strings
   - Matching attributes
   - Traversing the accessibility hierarchy
   - Resolving deep paths

3. Consider optimizations such as:
   - Caching frequently resolved paths
   - Using more efficient attribute matching algorithms
   - Adding indices for common attributes (like title, role)
   - Implementing shortcuts for common resolution patterns

4. Recommend performance improvements that would make path resolution more reliable for complex UIs
```

## 12. End-to-End Integration Test

```
Design a comprehensive integration test for path resolution:

1. Create a test that:
   - Launches a known application with a predictable UI (like Calculator)
   - Builds a map of the entire UI hierarchy with paths
   - Attempts to resolve each path back to its original element
   - Reports success rates and identifies patterns in failures

2. Use this test to:
   - Measure the reliability of path resolution
   - Identify specific pattern types that cause issues
   - Validate any fixes or improvements to the path resolver

The goal is to have a quantifiable measure of path resolution reliability that can be used to validate improvements.
```

## Implementation Plan

After completing these diagnostic steps, the information gathered should be synthesized into a comprehensive fix:

1. Document all identified issues with path resolution
2. Prioritize fixes based on impact and difficulty
3. Implement changes to address each issue
4. Add robust tests to verify correct behavior
5. Update documentation to clearly explain path format requirements

This structured approach will ensure that the ElementPath resolution system becomes more reliable, better documented, and easier to debug in the future.
